##  Description

This project demonstrates the following:

- **Game AI Design** ðŸ©·
  - The implementation of a smart AI using the **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning**. This allows the AI to analyze possible game outcomes and make the optimal move, ensuring that the player will always face a worthy opponent.
  - The AI's ability to handle all game scenariosâ€”wins, losses, and drawsâ€”provides a highly interactive and intelligent opponent.

- **Graphics Programming** ðŸ©·
  - **Raylib** is used to handle graphics and user interface (UI) elements. The intuitive graphics programming provided by Raylib makes it easy to create beautiful and responsive visual effects.
  - The game board has been designed to ensure smooth visual feedback, such as highlighting the selected cells during gameplay and displaying results at the end of each game.

- **Algorithm Optimization** ðŸ©·
  - The Minimax algorithm is optimized with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to increase efficiency by eliminating branches of the game tree that do not need to be explored. This ensures the AI makes decisions quickly, even in more complex game states.

- **C++ Concepts** ðŸ©·
  - The project covers a variety of key C++ concepts, including arrays, functions, control structures, and logical flow.
  - It provides a great starting point for anyone looking to understand game AI, algorithms, and interactive programming.
